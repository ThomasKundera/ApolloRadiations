# ApolloRadiations
Evaluation of radiations dose and effects during Apollo missions for both people and camera films, including solar, cosmics, VAB and Moon surface radioactivity.
Starting by Apollo 11.

## Summary of actions

### Solar rays
   - Getting realistic spectrum of solar radiations outside of solar storms, at Earth distance.
   - Getting their shapes from sea level up to Moon distance, so taking into account atmospheric and geomagnetism filtering.

### Comic rays
   - Getting realistic spectrum of interplanterary cosmic ray.
   - Getting their shapes from sea level up to Moon distance, so taking into account atmospheric and geomagnetism filtering.

### Moon surface radioactivity
   - Moon surface is slighty active, getting spectums shapes.

### Modelling trajectory of CSM/LM/EVAs
   - To get an integrated spectrump on a whole mission

### Modelling CSM and LM
   - Could be a very simple sphere to start with.
   - Get realistic spectrum behind their shielding.

### Modelling cameras
   - Could be a very simple sphere to start with
   - Get realistic spectrum behind their shielding.

### Modelling spacesuits
   - Also a very simple shape to start with.
   - Get realistic spectrum behind their shielding.

### Modelling rays/photographic film interactions
   - So that to know which effect to expect from a given dose

### Modelling rays/human interractions
   - To get an equivalent dose
