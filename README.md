# ApolloRadiations
Evaluation of radiations dose and effects during Apollo missions for both people and camera films, including solar, cosmics, VAB and Moon surface radioactivity.
Starting by Apollo 11.

## Summary of actions

### Solar rays
   - Getting realistic spectrum of solar radiations outside of solar storms, at Earth distance.
   - Getting their shapes from sea level up to Moon distance, so taking into account atmospheric and geomagnetism filtering.

### Comic rays
   - Getting realistic spectrum of interplanetary cosmic ray.
   - Getting their shapes from sea level up to Moon distance, so taking into account atmospheric and geomagnetism filtering.

### Moon surface radioactivity
   - Moon surface is slightly active, getting spectrum shapes.

### Modeling trajectory of CSM/LM/EVAs
   - To get an integrated spectrum on a whole mission

### Modeling CSM and LM
   - Could be a very simple sphere to start with.
   - Get realistic spectrum behind their shielding.

### Modeling cameras
   - Could be a very simple sphere to start with
   - Get realistic spectrum behind their shielding.

### Modeling spacesuits
   - Also a very simple shape to start with.
   - Get realistic spectrum behind their shielding.

### Modeling rays/photographic film interactions
   - So that to know which effect to expect from a given dose

### Modeling rays/human interactions
   - To get an equivalent dose


## Order of explanation

- sources of radiations?
- kinds of ionisation radiations emissions
- absorption/effects of rays
- matter becoming active?
