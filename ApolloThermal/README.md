# ApolloThermal
As a subproject of ApolloRadiations, study of thermal conditions of Apollo missions.
For now, focusing on temperature of films inside the EVA Hasselblad, but maybe more later.

## Summary of actions

### Moon surface thermal characteristics
   - Direct and indirect solar irradiance
   - Ground temperature

### Hasselblad
   - Surface properties
   - Inner structure
   - Thermal diffusion inside

### Film
   - Film base properties
   - Emulsion properties

### Modeling of an EVA
