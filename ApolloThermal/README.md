# ApolloThermal
As a sub-project of ApolloRadiations, study of thermal conditions of Apollo missions.
For now, focusing on temperature of films inside the EVA Hasselblad, but maybe more later.

## Summary of actions

### Moon surface thermal characteristics
   - Direct and indirect solar irradiance
   - Ground temperature and its radiations

### Hasselblad
   - Surface properties
   - Inner structure
   - Thermal diffusion inside

### Film
   - Film base properties
   - Emulsion properties

### Modeling of an EVA

### Resources

#### Camera and film
